# General Informatiom For HW03 Grading 
    * You'll have to do this on your own end
    * basically make a "HW02" dir on both server 
    * Server A make "server" dir in HW02 
    * Server B make "client" dir in HW02 
    * Also include a txt file with both our names in "server" ($touch team.txt)
    * Include a "testResultsClient.txt" in HW02/client on server B
